		<h1>YOUR WORLD IS WHAT YOU TWEET</h1>
		<p> How we perceive our surrounding is shaped by the many information we consume daily. The World Wide Web is the ideal
			place for that - endless and quick. But often there is only little time to orientate yourself or to look around in peace. </br> </br> 
			Scroll to take a tour through our city shaped by the internet. Do you know which way to go?</p>

	</div>

	<div class="textbox" id="scrollbox7">
		<h1>NO. 03</h1>
		<p>Try to identify the original source and check that source against other sources. If other newspapers havenâ€™t picked up this story itâ€™s probably fake.</p>

	<div class="textbox" id="scrollbox8">
		<h1>NO. 04</h1>
		<p>We are responsible for what is shared on the Web. Be mindful about what you repost.</p>
