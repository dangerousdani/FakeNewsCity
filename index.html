      <h1>Your world is what you tweet.</h1>
      <p>Your world is shaped according to what you believe in. Social media is one of the main sources of news these days. Therefore, your world will be shaped according to what is posted and liked on these platforms. Unfortunately, some malicious people know how to take advantage of this and spread opinions with emotionally statements which not necessarily have to be true. As an individual it is difficult to recognize whether a statement it true or wrong. But as long as you are not sure about it, you should at least avoid forwarding or liking this. If you want to find out the truth, you have to search for it ... </p>

      <h1>Trying to find the truth</h1>
      <p>Find out the truth these days is not easy. Changing the perspective could be one good start. People tent to like and retweet stuff that they find emotional. Most of them don't care if it could be a wrong statement. But don't be fooled by the fact that tweets are often liked. This does not make a statement true. Even worse, it drowns out the truth, making it even more difficult to discern. </p>

    <div class="textbox" id="scrollbox3">
      <h1>Try the bird's eye view</h1>
      <p>Only when you see the big picture you will notice that the number of likes no longer plays a big role. Now that you can no longer be fooled, you can better judge what is true and what is not.</p>
