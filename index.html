      <h1>Hello,</h1>
      <p class="text">
          we are Thao and Dani, communication design students at HTW Berlin.

          During the pandemic and the US election we were really impressed by how our surrounding can be shaped by the information we consume every day. In one moment the sewers in Venice are clear and in the next theyâ€™re not. Whether it's true or false is hard to identify. But our imagination of the world has already been shaped. And the more misinformation we obtain the more distorted our picture of the world gets. But it doesn't have to if we are all a bit more aware, not only of what we read and consume but also of what we tweet and share. 
          <br><br>
          This website collects fake news from all over the Internet and visualizes them to show how our world could look like when hoax news would be true. We want to show how a new point of view can help. Instead of feeling overwhelmed in the crowd of information take a step back. See everything as a whole to detect the hoaxes before spreading them.
