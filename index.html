      <h1>YOUR WORLD IS WHAT YOU TWEET</h1>
      <p>Our world is shaped according to what we believe in. Social media has a very high contribution to that. It is one of the main sources of news these days. Therefore, you are influenced by what is posted and spread on these platforms. Unfortunately, some malicious people know how to take advantage of this and spread opinions and statements which not necessarily have to be true. As an individual it is difficult to recognize whether a statement is true or wrong. If you want to find out the truth, you have to search for it ... </p>

      <h1>SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH</h1>
      <p>Finding out the truth these days is not easy. But changing the perspective could be one good start. People tend to like and retweet things that they are emotionally attracted to. Often it is not even considered if what they read or see is true or false. But don't be fooled by the fact that tweets are often liked. This does not make a statement true. Even worse, it drowns out the truth, making it even more difficult to discern. So, keep in mind that as long as you are not sure about it, you should at least avoid forwarding or liking the posts. </p>

      <h1>TRY THE BIRD'S EYE VIEW</h1>
      <p>Only when you see the big picture you will notice that the amount of engagement such as likes, reposts and comments no longer play a big role. Once you have thoroughly informed yourself about a topic, it is easy to recognize what is true and what is false. Now that you can no longer be fooled,do not hesitate to spread your knowledge among others.</p>
