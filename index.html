			  <h1>Hi,</h1>
			  <p class="text">we are Thao and Dani, communication design students at HTW Berlin.

        During the pandemic and US election we were really impressed how our surroundings can be shaped by the information we consume every day. In one moment the sewers in venedig are clear and in the next theyâ€™re not. Is it true or not, we donâ€™t know and also many others donâ€™t know the truth. But our imagination of the world has already been shaped. And when it was fake our picture of the world gets distorted. But it doesn't have to be if we all are a little more aware. Not only of what we read and consume but also what we tweet and share. 
        <br><br>
        This website tracks fakenews from twitter and visualizes them to show how our world can look like, when hoax news would be true. We want to show how a new point of view can help. Instead of feeling overwhelmed in the crowd of information, it may be better to take a step back and see the whole in a big context to detect hoax before spreading it.
        <br><br>
        Because this is such an important issue and there are experts fighting against disinformation, we want to engage you to have a look at the nice job netzpolitik.org and  corrective are doing. 
        <br><br>
        Thank you for your visit. Hope you enjoyed it!
